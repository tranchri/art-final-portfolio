Iâ€™m Christine and I am a 4th year computer science and studio art major at Grinnell College in Iowa.  As you may have guessed from my choice of majors, my passion lies at the intersection of art and technology. 

My resume can be found [here]({{root}}/img/CT2016.pdf), and my artist CV [here]({{root}}/img/CV.pdf).
